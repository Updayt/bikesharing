# Des Moines Bike-Sharing Program Business Proposal

## Overview of the analysis
We analyzed NYC bike-sharing data to show investors how popular the bike-sharing program in New York was. Our goal is to get an investor for our bike-sharing program in Des Moines and visualizing the data from New York will allow us to show the success of the program.

## Summary

We analyzed the bike repairs based on BikeID. This data is important because we need to see how often the bikes will need to be in for repair. If a bike is used more often at one location than another bike at a different location, we might want to rotate those bikes to reduce the damage on that busy bike.

Next, we observed the checkout time for users. This data is important because it will show us the average time a bike is out for. This data helps us determine how many bikes we will need to support the local demand. We also looked at the gender of a customer and how long their duration was. This is important to know because we need to look at the gender difference in Des Moines to see which gender based on NYC data would ride more. 

We looked at start time and stop time for users based on gender which helps us determine the most popular times for the ride share program. This information is critical because it allows us to find the slowest time for bike repairs. We also looked at the different type of customers which are a regular customer and a person who is a subscriber. 

Finally, we look looked at the total amount of riders. This number is the most important data to our research. If there is not a demand, then the bike-sharing program would fail. We want to make sure the current market has a demand for a bike-share program.

I would like to visualize average bike repair cost to see on average how much it cost for maintenance on a bike. The next visualization I would look at would be how much revenue difference is there between a customer and a subscriber to determine which  profile makes the most revenue and why.
